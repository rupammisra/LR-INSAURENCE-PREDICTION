# LR-INSAURENCE-PREDICTION

Certainly! The provided code performs an analysis using linear regression to understand the relationship between various factors and insurance charges. It utilizes Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling. Let's break down the code into paragraphs for a clearer explanation.

In the beginning, the code imports essential libraries such as Pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib for visualization, and Seaborn for enhanced visualizations. It also sets some styling parameters for the plots to make them more visually appealing.

The code then specifies the path to the dataset and reads the data from a CSV file named 'insurance.csv' into a Pandas DataFrame named `df`. It prints out the number of rows and columns in the dataset, providing an initial understanding of its size.

Next, the code displays the first few rows of the dataset using `df.head()`, giving a glimpse of the data and its structure. This helps in quickly grasping what kind of information is present in the dataset.

A scatterplot is created using Seaborn's `lmplot()` function. This plot visualizes the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and insurance charges. The linear regression line on the scatterplot helps understand how changes in BMI relate to changes in insurance charges.

To gain a statistical summary of the dataset, the code uses `df.describe()`, which provides key statistics like mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for the numerical columns.

The code then generates a heatmap to visualize missing values in the dataset. This is helpful in identifying columns with missing data, represented by yellow lines, and provides an initial indication of data completeness.

A correlation matrix heatmap is also generated using Seaborn. This heatmap displays the correlations between different numeric variables in the dataset. Positive or negative correlations help to understand potential relationships among variables.

The code groups the data by the 'children' column and calculates statistics like mean, minimum, and maximum insurance charges for each group. This provides insights into how the number of children might impact insurance charges.

Categorical columns like 'sex,' 'children,' 'smoker,' and 'region' are one-hot encoded using `pd.get_dummies()`, creating binary columns for each category. This process allows categorical data to be used in regression models.

The Box-Cox transformation is applied to the 'charges' column, aiming to stabilize the variance and make the data distribution more normal-like. This is useful for achieving better model performance.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split()`. This separation allows for model training on one subset and evaluation on another, helping assess the model's predictive ability.

Linear regression modeling is initiated using scikit-learn's `LinearRegression()`. The model is trained on the training data using `lin_reg.fit()`, and then predictions are made on the testing data using `lin_reg.predict()`.

Finally, the code evaluates the model's performance. It calculates and compares Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared values between the model's predictions and the actual values. These metrics indicate how well the model fits the data and how much of the variance in the target variable is explained by the model. Additionally, residual analysis is performed to check for linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, and other assumptions of linear regression.

Overall, the code showcases a comprehensive analysis pipeline involving data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation using linear regression.
